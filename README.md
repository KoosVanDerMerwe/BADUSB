THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! DO NOT USE THIS IN ANY MALICOUS WAY. YOU WILL FACE LEGAL CONSEQUENCE IF CAUGHT!

This Bad USB will go grab the users information, email (it will attempt), public IP, local IP, MAC address, wifi names and passwords

This can be used on either the flipper zero or a usb. If you want to put it onto a USB you will need to create a automatic USB.

The collected data will be saved to the file UsersLOOT.txt in the temp folder.

To use this, depending on what powershell version is on the victims PC. Most PC's have older powershell version so the "ULT-BADUSB-powershell.txt" file will work, but if the PC has a newer powershell version then you must use the "ULT-BADUSB-pwsh.txt" file. This script only works if the victims pc is using the UK language layout for its keyboard. For the flipper zero the script must be run using the uk keyboard layout
